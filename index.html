      <h1> Taylor Savage </h1>
  <p>Hi I am Taylor Savage, I am 24 years old and female. I graduated Kent State with a bachelors degree in marketing and entrpreneurship. 
    I am currently building my resume by adding tech experience through truecoders. After truecoders bootcamp I am hoping to get a job in the web development area. 
  I also own my own business, I run a rental property in Saint Augustine, and have been doing so for the apst 6 months. I also hope to acquire more rental properties in the future as it is a fun and efficient way to earn money.
I think with the added tech skills I will not only be able to get a better job, but also imrprove my overall entrepreneurial skills.</p>

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a beautiful game?"
